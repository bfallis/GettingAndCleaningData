End of course asignment for the Gettings and Cleaning Data Coursera course from JHU.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate student's ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

### Steps to run
The script will look for the downloaded zip file in the same folder as the script so when running this analysis please ensure to change the working directory to be the location of the source script.

### Files
- run_analysis.R: performs the analysis by fulfilling the 5 requirements defined in the objectives:
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity. and each subject.

- independent.txt
  - output text file from Step 5 above.

- README.MD: this file.
